Add themes (skins) to Gravity Forms

== Description ==

**PLEASE NOTE:** this is a plugin I wrote few years ago as a helper for a client's need and it's currently not maintained.
This last version just makes sure to solve possible compatibility issues.
If you wish to collaborate with this plugin and make it better (there are many aspects which can be improved), feel free to contact the author.

Misamee Gravity Forms Themes provide a couple of skins for your Gravity Forms and allows you to create your custom skins.
Skins can include just a CSS, but also one or more JavaScript and php files.

You also get a customized version of the standard Gravity Forms widget that allows you to select a theme.
